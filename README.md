# Digital Clock Project

## Overview
The **Digital Clock** project is a simple yet elegant clock that displays the current time, including hours, minutes, and seconds. It updates in real-time, using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. This project focuses on accurately displaying time and providing a visually appealing clock interface.

## Features
- **Real-Time Clock**: The clock displays hours, minutes, and seconds, updating every second to reflect the current time.
- **Dynamic Time Formatting**: Ensures that time is always displayed in a consistent format (e.g., two digits for hours, minutes, and seconds).
- **Clean and Simple UI**: Styled using CSS to create a minimalist, modern look, making the clock easy to read on any screen size.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the digital clock, including the time display areas for hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **CSS**: Provides styling for the clock, ensuring a clean and visually appealing layout, and makes the clock responsive across devices.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for updating the time every second and displaying it correctly on the interface.

## Key Sections
- **Time Display**: The main section of the clock that shows the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, dynamically updated using JavaScript.


## Key Learnings
During this project, I developed key skills in:
- **JavaScript Timing Functions**: Used `setInterval` to update the clock every second, ensuring real-time accuracy.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Learned how to manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript to display dynamic content.
- **CSS Styling**: Applied CSS techniques to design a clean, simple, and responsive interface for the digital clock.
